## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Claude API Demos, please report it to us privately.

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **DO** report security issues using GitHub's [Security Advisories](https://github.com/your-org/ai-instruction/security/advisories/new)
3. **Alternatively**, email us at security@your-org.com (if available)

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: The potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, provide a proof of concept
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas on how to fix the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Status Updates**: We will provide regular updates on our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Disclosure Policy

- We follow coordinated disclosure practices
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **API Key Security**
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use environment variables or `.env` files (excluded from git)
   - Rotate API keys regularly
   - Use API key restrictions when available

2. **Environment Security**
   - Keep your Python environment updated
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use virtual environments
   - Review package dependencies for vulnerabilities

3. **Code Security**
   - Review any custom code additions
   - Be cautious with user input in prompts
   - Validate and sanitize any external data

### For Contributors

1. **Development Security**
   - Never commit real API keys
   - Use mock API keys in tests
   - Review dependencies before adding them
   - Follow secure coding practices

2. **Code Review**
   - Review all changes for potential security issues
   - Check for hardcoded secrets or credentials
   - Validate input handling and sanitization
   - Review error handling to prevent information leakage

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

- **API Key Protection**: Environment variable usage with error handling
- **Input Validation**: Basic validation of user inputs
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- **Dependency Management**: Regular dependency scanning and updates

### Planned Security Enhancements

- Enhanced input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Additional security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Known Security Considerations

### API Usage
- This project makes calls to external APIs (Anthropic Claude)
- User inputs are sent to external services
- API responses are processed and displayed
- API keys are required and should be protected

### Dependencies
- The project relies on third-party Python packages
- Dependencies are regularly scanned for vulnerabilities
- Updates are applied promptly when security issues are identified

### Data Handling
- User inputs and API responses may be logged
- Temporary files may be created during R&D analytics operations
- No persistent storage of sensitive data by default
