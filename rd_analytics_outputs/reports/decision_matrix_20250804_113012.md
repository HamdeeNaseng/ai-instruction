7. RECOMMENDATION
Primary Recommendation: Scale up current process

Reasoning:
- Highest weighted score (7.4)
- Shortest time to market
- Lowest risk profile
- Balanced resource requirements
- Known process parameters
- Moderate investment needs

Secondary Recommendation: Optimize with DoE as parallel initiative

8. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Recommendation remains robust when:
- Time to market weight varies ±10%
- Cost weights vary ±15%
- Technical feasibility varies ±10%

Recommendation changes to DoE optimization if:
- Scalability importance increases >25%
- Risk tolerance increases significantly
- Timeline pressure decreases

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Scaling up the current process presents the most balanced approach with manageable risks and fastest time to market. Running DoE optimization in parallel could provide additional process understanding and improvement opportunities without compromising the primary scale-up timeline. The recommendation remains stable under most reasonable variations in criteria weighting.
