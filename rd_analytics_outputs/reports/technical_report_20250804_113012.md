ADVANCED PHARMACEUTICAL SYNTHESIS PROJECT
Progress Report - August 2024

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The optimization phase of the Advanced Pharmaceutical Synthesis project has achieved significant success, with process parameters exceeding target metrics. Key achievements include:
- Yield optimization at 88.7% (target: >85%)
- Purity levels reaching 97.8% (target: >95%)
- Cost reduction to $15K per batch (target: <$20K)
- Process time reduction to 2.0 hours at optimal conditions

Recommendation: Proceed with pilot scale-up implementation while conducting parallel validation studies.
