Continuous flow |   12-15   |    4.0-5.0   |     0.5-0.7
```

7. RECOMMENDATION
Primary Recommendation: Scale up current process

Reasoning:
- Lowest risk profile
- Fastest time to market
- Proven technical feasibility
- Balanced resource requirements
- Acceptable ROI
- Maintains process knowledge

8. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Recommendation remains robust under:
- ±20% cost variations
- ±30% timeline shifts
- ±25% resource availability

Recommendation changes if:
- Regulatory requirements shift significantly
- Market demand doubles unexpectedly
- Competitive pressure requires >40% cost reduction

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Scaling up the current process offers the optimal balance of risk, speed, and return. While other options show potential long-term benefits, the immediate business needs are best served by this approach. The decision is robust under most scenarios but should be reviewed if market conditions change dramatically.

Next Steps:
1. Detailed scale-up protocol development
2. Equipment specification and procurement
3. Timeline and budget finalization
4. Team assembly and training
5. Risk mitigation strategy implementation
