- High initial investment
- Training requirements
- Process validation complexity

4. COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS (Rough Estimates)

Scale up current:
- Investment: $2-3M
- ROI timeline: 12-18 months
- Operating costs: Moderate

Optimize with DoE:
- Investment: $1-2M
- ROI timeline: 18-24 months
- Operating costs: Low-Moderate

Alternative catalyst:
- Investment: $3-4M
- ROI timeline: 24-36 months
- Operating costs: Unknown

Continuous flow:
- Investment: $5-7M
- ROI timeline: 36-48 months
- Operating costs: Low

5. TIMELINE CONSIDERATIONS

Scale up current: 6-9 months
Optimize with DoE: 12-18 months
Alternative catalyst: 18-24 months
Continuous flow: 24-36 months

6. RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

Scale up current:
- Personnel: 8-10 FTEs
- Equipment: Existing + scale-up units
- Budget: Medium

Optimize with DoE:
- Personnel: 5-7 FTEs
- Equipment: Existing + analytical
- Budget: Low-Medium

Alternative catalyst:
- Personnel: 12-15 FTEs
- Equipment: New reactor systems
- Budget: High

Continuous flow:
- Personnel: 15-20 FTEs
- Equipment: Complete new system
- Budget: Very High

7. RECOMMENDATION

Primary Recommendation: Scale up current process

Reasoning:
- Best balance of risk and reward
- Fastest time to market
- Leverages existing knowledge
- Moderate resource requirements
- Known technology and processes
- Clear regulatory pathway
- Favorable cost-benefit ratio

8. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

The recommendation remains robust under various scenarios:
- Cost variations: ±20%
- Timeline shifts: ±3 months
- Resource availability: ±25%

Only significant changes in multiple parameters would alter the recommendation. The next best alternative (Optimize with DoE) would become preferred if:
- Scale-up faces major technical challenges
- Development timeline extends >6 months
- Resource constraints become severe

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Scaling up the current process presents the optimal path forward, offering the best balance of risk, speed, and resource utilization. While other options offer potential benefits, their longer timelines and higher uncertainties make them less attractive for immediate implementation. The recommendation is robust under various scenarios and aligns with current business objectives.
