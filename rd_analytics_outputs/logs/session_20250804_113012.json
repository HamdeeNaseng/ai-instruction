Data Overview\n- Temperature range: 25-45\u00b0C\n- Yield range: 78.5-88.7%\n- Purity range: 94.8-97.8%\n- Reaction time range: 2.0-2.5 hours\n- Dataset contains 5 experimental conditions\n\n## 2. Statistical Analysis\n\nKey Correlations:\n- Temperature vs Yield: Strong positive correlation up to 40\u00b0C, then decreases\n- Temperature vs Purity: Peak at 35\u00b0C (97.8%), declining at higher temperatures\n- Temperature vs Reaction Time: Slight negative correlation (faster at higher temps)\n\nTrends:\n- Yield shows parabolic behavior with maximum at 40\u00b0C\n- Purity exhibits optimal point at 35\u00b0C\n- Reaction time generally decreases with temperature\n\nNo significant outliers detected.\n\n## 3. Key Insights\n1. Optimal temperature appears to be between 35-40\u00b0C\n2. Best combination of parameters:\n   - Temperature: 40\u00b0C\n   - Yield: 88.7%\n   - Purity: 96.5%\n   - Reaction time: 2.0 hours\n3. Trade-off exists between yield and purity\n4. Higher temperatures generally improve efficiency but may compromise purity\n\n## 4. Potential Issues\n1. Limited data points (only 5 conditions)\n2. No replicates to assess reproducibility\n3. No error margins provided\n4. Gap in temperature intervals (5\u00b0C steps) might miss fine optimal points\n\n## 5. Recommendations\n1. Conduct additional experiments:\n   - Focus on 35-40\u00b0C range with smaller intervals\n   - Include replicates for statistical validity\n   - Extend temperature range to confirm trends\n2. Investigate:\n   - Reaction mechanism at higher temperatures\n   - Impurity profile at different conditions\n   - Cost-benefit analysis of longer reaction times vs yield\n\n## 6. Decision Support\n\nImmediate Implementation:\n- Set operating temperature at 40\u00b0C for maximum yield\n- Use 35\u00b0C if higher purity is priority\n\nShort-term Actions:\n1. Validate reproducibility at optimal conditions\n2. Implement quality control at identified optimal parameters\n3. Document process parameters for scale-up\n\nLong-term Strategy:\n1. Develop robust process control around optimal conditions\n2. Consider economic factors (energy costs vs yield)\n3. Evaluate potential for continuous process optimization\n\nPriority Next Steps:\n1. Run validation batches at 40\u00b0C\n2. Conduct detailed impurity analysis\n3. Perform cost analysis of operating conditions\n\nThis analysis suggests focusing on the 35-40\u00b0C range for optimal balance of yield, purity, and reaction time, with specific conditions depending on priority metrics.",
