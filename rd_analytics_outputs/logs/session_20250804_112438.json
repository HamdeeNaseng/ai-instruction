DATA OVERVIEW\n---------------\n\u2022 Temperature range: 25-45\u00b0C\n\u2022 Yield range: 78.5-88.7%\n\u2022 Purity range: 94.8-97.8%\n\u2022 Reaction time range: 2.0-2.5 hours\n\u2022 Sample size: 5 data points per variable\n\n2. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS\n-----------------------\nTrends:\n\u2022 Yield shows positive correlation with temperature up to 40\u00b0C, then decreases\n\u2022 Purity peaks at 35\u00b0C (97.8%)\n\u2022 Reaction time generally decreases with increasing temperature\n\u2022 No apparent outliers in the dataset\n\nCorrelations:\n\u2022 Temperature-Yield: Strong positive correlation up to 40\u00b0C\n\u2022 Temperature-Purity: Moderate quadratic relationship\n\u2022 Temperature-Reaction Time: Negative correlation\n\n3. KEY INSIGHTS\n---------------\n\u2022 Optimal temperature appears to be 40\u00b0C for maximum yield (88.7%)\n\u2022 Best purity achieved at 35\u00b0C (97.8%)\n\u2022 Fastest reaction time at 40\u00b0C (2.0 hours)\n\u2022 Trade-off exists between yield and purity\n\u2022 Sweet spot appears to be in 35-40\u00b0C range\n\n4. POTENTIAL ISSUES\n------------------\n\u2022 Limited data points (only 5 temperatures)\n\u2022 No replicates to assess reproducibility\n\u2022 No error margins provided\n\u2022 Gap in temperature range (5\u00b0C intervals may miss optimal points)\n\u2022 No information on side products or impurity profiles\n\n5. RECOMMENDATIONS\n-----------------\n\u2022 Conduct additional experiments in 35-40\u00b0C range with 1\u00b0C intervals\n\u2022 Include replicates for statistical validation\n\u2022 Analyze impurity profiles at different temperatures\n\u2022 Consider investigating other parameters (concentration, pH, etc.)\n\u2022 Perform longer-term stability studies at optimal conditions\n\n6. DECISION SUPPORT\n------------------\nImmediate Actions:\n1. Set initial production parameters at:\n   - Temperature: 37-38\u00b0C (compromise between yield and purity)\n   - Expected reaction time: ~2.1 hours\n   - Expected yield: ~87%\n   - Expected purity: ~97%\n\n2. Process Controls:\n   - Maintain tight temperature control (\u00b11\u00b0C)\n   - Monitor reaction progress at 2-hour mark\n   - Implement in-process purity checks\n\n3. Further Development:\n   - Validate process with 3 production-scale batches\n   - Establish specification limits based on additional data\n   - Document process parameters in standard operating procedures\n\nThis optimization suggests a viable process with good yield and purity, but additional validation work is recommended for robust commercial implementation.",
