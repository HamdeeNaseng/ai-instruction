## ðŸš€ Context Optimization Techniques

### Token Efficiency Strategies

**Context Compression**:
```yaml
# Optimized context format
analysis_context_compressed:
  analyst: "DataSci@[DOMAIN]@12yr"
  dataset: "[SOURCE]|[SIZE]|[TIMEFRAME]"
  objective: "[GOAL]|[STAKEHOLDERS]|[DECISIONS]"
  methods: "[STATISTICAL_TESTS]|[SIGNIFICANCE]|[VALIDATION]"
  output: "[SUMMARY]|[TECHNICAL]|[RECOMMENDATIONS]"
```

**Context Reuse Patterns**:
- Domain expertise loaded once per domain
- Statistical methodology cached across similar analyses  
- Business context templates for recurring analysis types
- Stakeholder preference profiles for consistent communication
