    skill_gaps: "[MISSING_SKILLS] requiring [TRAINING/HIRING]"
    team_size: "[CURRENT_SIZE] with [SCALING_PLAN]"
    
  project_constraints:
    timeline: "[PROJECT_DURATION] with [MILESTONES]"
    budget: "[BUDGET_ALLOCATION] for [COST_CATEGORIES]"
    dependencies: "[EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCIES] + [INTERNAL_DEPENDENCIES]"
```

**AI Agent Prompt**:
```
ROLE: Technical Project Manager with delivery expertise
CONTEXT: Implementation planning for [PROJECT_SCOPE]
RESOURCES: [TEAM_CAPABILITIES] within [PROJECT_CONSTRAINTS]

PLANNING_FRAMEWORK:
1. Work Breakdown: Decompose technical work into manageable tasks
2. Resource Allocation: Match tasks to team capabilities and availability
3. Timeline Planning: Create realistic timeline with buffer and dependencies
4. Risk Mitigation: Plan for technical and resource risks
5. Quality Assurance: Define testing and validation checkpoints

- Project timeline with critical path
- Risk mitigation plan
- Quality assurance framework

SUCCESS_METRICS: On-time delivery, Budget adherence, Quality targets, Stakeholder satisfaction
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Context Optimization Techniques

### Token Efficiency Strategies

**Hierarchical Context Loading**:
- Load enterprise context once per session
- Reuse domain context across similar projects  
- Refresh project context per major milestone
- Update task context per analysis iteration

**Context Compression Patterns**:
```yaml
# Compressed context format
context_compressed:
  role: "[TITLE]@[DOMAIN]@[YEARS_EXP]"
  scope: "[PROJECT_TYPE]|[SIZE]|[DURATION]"
  constraints: "[BUDGET]|[TIMELINE]|[RESOURCES]"
  deliverables: "[OUTPUT1]|[OUTPUT2]|[OUTPUT3]"
  quality: "[METRIC1]:[TARGET1]|[METRIC2]:[TARGET2]"
```

### Quality Assurance Framework

**Validation Checkpoints**:
- [ ] Context completeness verified
- [ ] Stakeholder alignment confirmed  
- [ ] Technical feasibility validated
- [ ] Business value quantified
- [ ] Risk assessment completed
- [ ] Implementation plan reviewed

**Performance Metrics**:
- Analysis accuracy: >95%
- Stakeholder satisfaction: >4.5/5
- Implementation success rate: >90%
- Time to delivery: <baseline
- Cost efficiency: Within budget Â±5%

- **[FEATURE/PRODUCT]**: Specific feature or product being analyzed

### Context Enhancement
Add relevant project-specific context:

- **Technology Stack**: Current and planned technologies
- **User Demographics**: Target user characteristics and behaviors
- **Business Constraints**: Budget, timeline, regulatory limitations
- **Success Metrics**: Specific KPIs and measurement criteria

### Output Customization
Modify expected deliverables based on:

- **Organization Standards**: Company-specific documentation formats
- **Project Methodology**: Agile, Waterfall, or hybrid approaches
- **Stakeholder Preferences**: Detailed vs. high-level documentation needs
- **Technical Requirements**: Specific technical documentation standards

## Best Practices

### Effective PRP Implementation
1. **Iterative Refinement**: Use multiple rounds of prompting to refine requirements
2. **Stakeholder Validation**: Regularly validate AI-generated requirements with stakeholders
3. **Context Maintenance**: Keep project context current and detailed
4. **Quality Assurance**: Review and validate all AI-generated content
5. **Documentation**: Maintain clear records of requirement evolution

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Over-reliance on AI without human validation
- Insufficient project context leading to generic requirements
- Skipping stakeholder review and approval processes
- Failing to update requirements as project evolves
- Ignoring technical constraints and dependencies
