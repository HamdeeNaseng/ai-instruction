# Product Requirements Prompts (PRPs) - Advanced Context Engineering Framework

## Overview

Product Requirements Prompts (PRPs) is an advanced context engineering methodology that leverages AI agents to systematically gather, analyze, and refine product requirements through a structured 6-layer context flow. This framework is optimized for enterprise environments requiring high-quality, consistent, and traceable requirements engineering.

## üéØ PRP Context Engineering Architecture

### Framework Principles

**Context Optimization**: Each layer builds upon previous context, minimizing redundancy while maximizing comprehension

**Agentic Design**: Specifically engineered for autonomous AI agent workflows with minimal human intervention

**Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation checkpoints ensure consistent, reliable outputs

**Stakeholder Alignment**: Multi-perspective integration with systematic stakeholder validation

**Performance Metrics**: Trackable success criteria and continuous improvement mechanisms
